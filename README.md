Please submit the interview problems posted in slack channel here. The problems and statements are intentionally not shown here so that students are not able to see them in advance 

problem1 - find peak element 
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
